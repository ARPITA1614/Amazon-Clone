# Amazon-Clone
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage created using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the visual layout and styling of Amazon’s main landing page, including the navigation bar, logo, search bar, sign-in section, cart icon, banner images, and a grid of product cards. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate proficiency in responsive web design using pure HTML and CSS without any JavaScript or frameworks.
Since the project is static, it does not include real search functionality, login logic, or cart operations—its primary focus is visual presentation and layout replication. This clone is ideal for front-end beginners looking to improve their CSS layout skills or build a portfolio-ready project. You can view the design by opening the index.html file in any browser. The entire code is well-commented and organized for readability and further development.
